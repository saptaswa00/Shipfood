Callback: It is a function which we want to execute after a cetain time later or to execute any meaningfull operaton.
Promise: It is a object tat keep on checking wheather order accepted or not , when restaurant eventually
         responds(A/R) it'll tell us. 

promise => then, catch     :  callback => resolve, reject

//

Types of promise..............

1.  promise.all 
    => Every operation got called parallaly, if one operation fails whole operation fails and will call for an error.

2.  promise.allsettled 
    => Here also every operation got called parallaly, but if one fails other operation won't effect

3.  promise.race
    => First promise to fullfilled wheather its resolved or rejected
    => Ex: 1. Reject, 2. Reject, 3. Resolve 4. Reject........
    => It'll return "Your Request is rejected" at 1st.....then after two itaration it'll show Resolve , cause 1st promise got rejected.

4.  promise.any
    => First operation/promise to fullfill when its resolved......won't return rjected one.
    => Ex: 1. Reject, 2. Reject, 3. Resolve 4. Reject
    => It'll return "Your Request is Resolve", cause its only fullfilled when resolved , so it'll take 3rd one as consideration.

 The primary difference between CALLBACK and PROMISE is .....

 i. In callback we give fixed time for one itaration, 
      i.e, we check after 5 sec wheather the work is done or not, 1 time only.
ii. In promises we can do this process repeatedly, i.e we can itarate until we find the result,
     Ex- we check after every 5 sec wheather the work is done or not until we get responce.

Pure function: Only has one work to do, only do that single work and stop.
